## Where does it come from?
  - Lean Manufacturing / Lean Production

  - Systematic method for waste minimization within a value stream without sacrificing productivity

  - Waste definition: combination of overburden and unevenness of work loads



## Basic Kanban 
  - Kanban (= japanese term which translates to signboard / billboard)

  - Method to uncover waste withing a value stream

  - Buckets with a sign and filled with material

Note: 
Waste types
moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing
all components, work in process, and finished product not being processed
people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing
waiting for the next production step, interruptions of production during shift change
production ahead of demand
resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity
the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects



## Kanban rules
  - An incoming request provides the quantity of the items needed

  - Production and Transport of an item is always associated with a request

  - The request is always physically attached to an item

  - A finished item is always flawless

  - The number of pending requests is limited



## Most basic example
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="/slides/images/kanban/tps.jpg" -->

Note: 
We have a bucket with material we use
we use all the material till the bucket is empty
the (Kanban) card attached to the bucket is moved to the source of supply
the source fills the bucket with flawless material and sends it back to the supplier
